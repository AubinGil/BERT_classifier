# üè• Predicting 30-Day Hospital Readmission from Discharge Notes (MIMIC-IV)

üß† This repository explores clinical language modeling to predict whether a patient will be readmitted within 30 days of hospital discharge. Leveraging discharge summaries from the MIMIC-IV dataset, the model fine-tunes Clinical_ModernBERT, a cutting-edge domain-specific transformer architecture optimized for medical text.
üöÄ Unlike standard BERT models which typically handle input lengths up to 512 tokens, Clinical_ModernBERT supports sequences up to 8192 tokens, enabling it to process entire clinical notes without truncation. This expanded context window allows the model to capture rich, nuanced medical information spanning discharge summaries, assessments, and care plans‚Äîboosting its ability to detect patterns linked to readmission risk.

## üìå Project Overview

- **Objective:** Predict unplanned hospital readmissions using discharge notes from ICU stays in MIMIC-IV.
- **Approach:** Fine-tune `Clinical_ModernBERT` on chunked discharge summaries using a custom focal loss function to address long input sequences and class imbalance.
- **Key Features:**
  - ‚úÖ Chunk-based input handling for long notes
  - ‚úÖ Focal loss implementation
  - ‚úÖ Mixed precision training with AMP
  - ‚úÖ Evaluation with AUC, F1 score, and accuracy

## üß† Model Architecture

| Component              | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| üß† Base Model          | `Simonlee711/Clinical_ModernBERT` (Transformer-based language model)        |
| ‚úÇÔ∏è Chunked Input        | Split notes into 512-token chunks; apply mean pooling over BERT outputs     |
| üéØ Loss Function        | pos_weight is used to manually rebalance the training process, ensuring the model doesn't disproportionately favor one category over another |
| ‚ö°Ô∏è Training Acceleration| Enabled via `torch.cuda.amp` (Automatic Mixed Precision)                    |

## üóÇ Dataset: MIMIC-IV

- **Source:** MIMIC-IV v2.2
- **Cohort:** Adult ICU patients with discharge summaries
- **Inputs:** Combined sections from `noteevents` and structured EHR columns:
  - Chief Complaint
  - History of Present Illness
  - Major Procedure
  - Brief Hospital Course
  - Discharge Diagnosis
  - Discharge Instructions
- **Target:** Binary label for 30-day readmission

## üìä Performance (Validation/Test)

| Metric   | Score                   |
|----------|------------------------|
| AUC      | 0.7023                  |
| F1 Score | 0.65 (Readmitted)       |
|          | 0.64 (Not Readmitted)   |
| Accuracy | ~65%                    |
